THINGS TO NOTE:
1. Upon opening of the Chrome Browser, check if the challenge is provided by hCaptcha. If it is cloudflare, try emptying the cache and restarting the program. This problem is on CloudFlare's end, which affects Chrome browsers.

2. When solving the Captcha, add a delay before pressing verify, since solving the Captcha too fast will not allow you to enter the site.

Instructions:

1. Open run.bat

2. Input desired analysis date in the form of (MM/DD/YYYY).

3. (Optional) Provide a last URL collected to look out for in order to stop the scraper from collecting duplicates of previously collected sites.

4. Chrome Browser should open and user can start solving the Captcha.

5. Upon entering the site, switch to the command prompt and enter 'y' to start scraping.
